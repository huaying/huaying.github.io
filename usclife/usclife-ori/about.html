            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>It is very difficult to keep up with all the events, career fairs, tech talks, organization events etc. occurring every day throughout USC.
                Current ways to receive details regarding campus events include Facebook, emails, and word-of-mouth. However, the information presented in these forms still remains vague and cannot be found in a single, cohesive, and comprehensive location. </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">USCLife</span> attempts to rectify this by providing users with a sole source that allows them to easily view all events occurring around the university.
